# 熟語 - jukugo

A tool for learning Japanese, with two main usages:
* Kyoushi - Progress through each kanji by grade level in the kyouiku kanji.  Selecting a kanji adds it to your "known" list, and fetches new words that can be written using the kanji you know so far.
* Sagasu - Select words made up of kanji of various kyōiku grade levels, hiragana, katakana, and romaji.  For instance, if you are learning grades 1 and 2 of the kyouiku kanji, you can select words made up only of the kanji from those grades (as well as kana).
